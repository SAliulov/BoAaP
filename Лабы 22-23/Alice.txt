Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
Lewis Carroll

Chapter I
DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the

book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 
“and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or 
conversation?”

    You wanna know the mistake you’re making here, buddy?
    You think you’re gonna find the truth.
    You think you’ll uncover something, and everything will just…fall into place.
    Some grand revelation, that’ll make sense of all these unspeakable horrors.
    That’ll explain what could drive men to such creative extremes of inhumanity.
    I hate to be the one to break the bad news, but even when you think you understand what’s happening here, you’re only gonna be halfway down the rabbit hole.
    It’s always been the case that whoever’s holding the money gets to say what the truth is.
    But then, then what happens, when all the money's gone?
    When everything is based on debt? On credit?
    Come on, buddy, you can guess this one. It's faith.
    Money is a matter of faith.
    All we were ever trying to do is sell you the dream, but you can't make a deal if you've got nothing to bargain with.
    You gotta be inside the dream to buy it. You gotta. Have. Faith. And that's what I'm here for. To make you believe.
